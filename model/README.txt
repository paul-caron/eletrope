Walking Elephant 3D Zoetrope by 3Dimka on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1059990

Summary:
Video of zoetrope in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E09L5mKf18These are 3D models of working 3D zoetrope. There are 10 poses of walking elephant.In this version I used stepper motor and LED strobe light controlled by arduino. I'm planning to improve design in the future. The best effect can be observed in the dark, ambient light will add motion smudges.The elephants print better upside down, they need to be resized to scale of 0.3 (sorry, forgot to do that before exporting to STL).The elephants then need to be glued to the inserts using glue gun and then inserted into the disk. The trick is to align the animals in the same order, 01 to 10. If some poses don't align, a head gun can be used to melt the glue and re-adjust pose correspondingly.The purpose of inserts is to be able to use different animations on the same rig. However you can glue the elephants to the disk, in this case no need to print the inserts.More details on http://www.cthackerspace.com/lets-not-ignore-the-elephant-in-the-room/
